<!-- ```{r figurename, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="my caption", out.width = '90%'}

``` -->
<p>Choose the appropriate level of detail for your MA topic. The topic of your meta-analysis should be broader than the one of a single experiment (e.g. “How do babies segment words of different stress patterns?”), but narrower than a whole research field (e.g. “How do babies learn language?”). The goal is to be able to gather comparable papers, measuring consistant dependant variables, to allow you to compute a common statistical metric (i.e. effect size) from them.</p>
<p>Define your population of interest precisely. Homogeneous can mean many things; age, language, typical versus atypical. You may run a meta-analysis where you accept many different levels for some of the variables and see how it affects results, defining them as MA moderators, for example seeing if effects are consistent across ages. There should still be some unifying element in your studies though so you have one broad result of your meta-analysis.</p>
<p>Consider the number of available studies on your topic. Your MA topic also depends on how many studies have been done on it. If you want to run a simple comparative MA, as few as two studies could be okay. But if you want to run an analysis with a lot of moderators, 5 studies probably isn’t enough to warrant a meta-analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-should-i-bother-keeping-track-of-the-ma-creation-process" class="section level3">
<h3>Why should I bother keeping track of the MA creation process?</h3>
<div class="vembedr">
<div>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPlKC2feqNo" width="533" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" data-external="1"></iframe>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is important that you build traceability of your work from the start,
particularly since in larger MAs other people may finish up the
work or you want to check later on why you decided to exclude a given
paper. So to make sure that all of your decisions are recorded and
clear, make a copy of this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mtN4g6FddpBljQzrR-mS0y414M9wQNjK4Vz09nLOe2s/edit#gid=0"><em>decision
spreadsheet</em></a>.
Don’t forget to rename it, to give us a “viewing” link, and clean it up
as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Click on “File” and select the “Make a copy…” option</p>
<p><img src="https://langcog.github.io/metalab/media/documentation/image04.jpg" style="width:5in" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: In the window that appears, change the name to something like
“MA_TOPIC”</p>
<p><img src="https://langcog.github.io/metalab/media/documentation/image03.jpg" style="width:5in" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click on the blue button “Share” on the top right.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: In the menu, click on “Get shareable link” on the top
right</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Copy the link and send it to us.</p>
<p><img src="https://langcog.github.io/metalab/media/documentation/image05.jpg" style="width:5in" /></p>
<p>Step 6: Clean up</p>
<p>The model spreadsheet contains some fake entries and notes. Our
recommendation is, so as not to get confused, to remove the instructions
found on the top lines of each sheet and the fake information that is
already entered - except for a couple of exceptions: the pink columns
(A, B and W) in the Relevant_studies_search sheet contain formulas
that may be useful to you. So you might want to delete the contents of
the other columns and keep those two in order to reuse the formulas.</p>
<p>************</p>
<p>Additionally, make a copy of <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DKY8BTZZ82bGyGwpGsyyzsilOqE1F1NcDLTKWtCe9AY/edit?usp=sharing"><em>this
flowchart</em></a>,
rename and share as you did for your spreadsheet above. This figure
gives you an overview of the process, and you will be filling in the
boxes with the right numbers as you go along so that people who continue
this MA and/or those interested in assessing this work can make sure
that you followed the procedure.</p>
</div>
<div id="now-that-i-have-my-list-of-related-studies-how-do-i-set-my-inclusion-criteria" class="section level3">
<h3>Now that I have my list of related studies, how do I set my inclusion criteria?</h3>

</div>
</div>
<p>Probably not. In this step, you will go through the initial list you put together in
step 2, and make decisions to include/exclude papers, mostly based on
the abstract. In addition to creating your sample for data entry (step
4) you will start honing your <em>inclusion criteria</em>. Typically, these
will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>a homogeneous scientific question</strong>:
&gt; Make sure you have clearly
&gt; defined the purview of e.g. cross-situational learning (e.g., this
&gt; name itself is vague to those outside the domain, so define it in
&gt; a more specific way: “exposure to sets of images paired with
&gt; wordforms with the goal of studying word-form image association,
&gt; but crucially multiple images are shown at once (unlike e.g. the
&gt; switch procedure)”)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>a homogeneous infant population</strong>:
&gt; Typically-developing children,
&gt; between the ages of XX and YY (the precise ages may stem from your
&gt; seminal paper; perhaps to start with, you could set the maximum to
&gt; 36 months, the minimum to 0 months); consider whether you also
&gt; need to restrict the sample based on infants’ native language <em>on
&gt; theoretical reasons</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is perhaps the trickiest. Staying close to your seminal
paper will allow you to reduce the amount of variation in your sample
due to methodological “details”, and to make it easier for yourself to
enter data, because all the results will be structured in similar ways.
But it’s important to know that this is a potential source of bias. For
instance, you could decide that you will only input data using a
specific kind of artificial language because you know that papers not
using this language have smaller effects. This will end up being a
self-confirmation exercise – unless there are a priori strong
theoretical reasons to exclude other kinds of language or to assume
that the learning mechanisms attributed to the infant cannot be
generalized to these other languages.</p>
<p>Every time you make a decision regarding these and other key criteria,
remember to note it in your decision spreadsheet, in the last sheet
called “Notes_inclusion”. For example, mine looks like this:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="19%" />
<col width="74%" />

</div>
</div>
<p>The goal of this step is to put together a list of publications that you
will look at and consider for inclusion. In a typical MA, you make the
most comprehensive list possible in order to answer a specific research
question and/or to cover a given phenomenon. This typically means going
through 1,000 abstracts, and reading in full 100 papers.
You can start with the seminal paper for your effect of interest, and then look for the studies citing your seminal one. Use <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced">pubmed’s search</a> to find your pivot study’s entry, for instance by copy-pasting the full paper title in the builder:</p>
<p><img src="https://langcog.github.io/metalab/media/documentation/pubmed_advanced_search.jpg" style="width:5in" /></p>
<p>When you press “search”, usually you’ll find the entry for your seminal paper (or if the title was not unique, you might need to click on one of the entries found until you do come across the entry for your seminal paper). Notice on the right a section entitled “Cited by …” Scroll down to click on the link at the bottom of this section stating “See all..”</p>
<p><img src="https://langcog.github.io/metalab/media/documentation/pubmed_citing_papers.jpg" style="width:5in" /></p>
<p>You will now see all studies citing your seminal one. Constrain it further by clicking on “Show additional filters” on the left, and checking the box for “Infant: birth to 23 months”:</p>
<p><img src="https://langcog.github.io/metalab/media/documentation/links_from_pubmed.jpg" style="width:5in" /></p>
<p>You now want to save all these papers in your reference management software.
If you use Zotero: Click on the drawing of a folder in your status/search bar. When you do so, a window will pop up with all the results for that pubmed page:</p>
<p><img src="https://langcog.github.io/metalab/media/documentation/save2Zotero.jpg" style="width:5in" /></p>
<p>Click on “select all” and “OK”. Repeat for the other search pages. This will store the citation information, including abstract, in zotero.</p>
<p>You can also interrogate Pubmed with a script, such as <a href="https://gist.github.com/mcfrank/c1ec74df1427278cbe53">the one we have prepared</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>What if the title and abstract doesn’t allow me to decide?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>What if the title and abstract doesn’t allow me to decide, but in
fact I know the paper and I know it needs to be excluded?</em></strong></p>
<p>Then you probably have already seen the full text of the paper, so say
“yes” for the screening decision, and then “no” for the full-text
decision.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-many-papers-should-i-enter" class="section level3">
<h3>How many papers should I enter?</h3>
<p>Ideally, you would enter everything: published or unpublished, proceedings or journal, etc. However, sometimes you may want to start a “seed” meta-analysis that just gives a rough idea of an area.</p>
<p>In this case, how large should your sample be? Mika and Molly have done some <a href="https://rawgit.com/langcog/metalab/master/resampling/resampling.html">simulations</a> to help you decide. By and large, it looks like the more, the better – clearly estimates get more precise (confidence intervals narrow) as more papers are entered. Based on this information, we are proposing <em>a minimum of 10 included experiments</em> as a pragmatic first step, knowing that your estimate is not very precise.</p>

(create a copy, as you did in step 1), and follow the <a href="https://langcog.github.io/metalab/documentation.html#field_specs"><em>field specifications</em></a>.
Ideally, you would code all potentially relevant moderator variables
(e.g., experimental manipulations) in addition to the core
characteristics (columns in red; e.g. means). However, in the interest
of time, you can get started with the core characteristics only.

<p>Here are some FAQs we have received on this:</p>

<p>How many rows you make depends on how the results are reported. In this case, the authors report the outcome separately for all four groups. Therefore, please enter the four groups separately; each into their own row. You can copy over descriptions of the experiment.</p>
<p><strong><em>In Experiment 1, there are two age groups. Do I have to report the age for both groups or do I average both groups into one? If I have to report both groups, how do I report this in the input form?</em></strong></p>
<p>How many rows you make depends on how the results are reported.

<h3>How do I retrieve studies?</h3>
<p>In a typical full MA, you go through the whole list and only then start
entering. The procedure is as follows. Go back to your spreadsheet, and
for each study that has been decided as a “yes” during screening, try to
retrieve the full text for the paper as you normally would (e.g., search
through scholar.google.com; regular google; your institution’s library,
etc.) If you cannot retrieve it, update your spreadsheet sheet
Relevant_studies_search to mark this paper as “no” in column F
entitled “Fulltext_retrieved”. If you want, you can contact the authors
to try to get the full text from them, in which case you can note this
on column G.</p>
<p>If you do find the full text, go through the paper to find the first
experiment reported. You will enter all experiments and conditions one
at a time, and fill in their information in the MA spreadsheet you
created in step 4.

<p>IMPORTANT: You should work backwards from the <strong>results</strong> section: look
at what dependent measures are reported fully enough that you will be
able to extract an effect size from them.</p>
<p>The following information
allows one to calculate an effect size (we are sticking to experimental
designs, since most of our MAs are experimental):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>between-participant studies</strong>:
&gt; Means and SDs (not SEs!) of the
&gt; dependent variable for each infant group** are all that is
&gt; required for the calculation of Cohen’s d. Sometimes, means and
&gt; SDs are not available as numbers. If there are clear figures, you
&gt; can try to estimate means and SDs using** <a href="http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/"><strong>this online
&gt; app</strong></a>*. If you decide to
&gt; estimate values from figures, add a column to keep track of this.
&gt; Finally, <strong>t or F values for the <em>main</em> effect in combination with
&gt; sample sizes</strong> can be used to calculate Cohen’s d. Note them
&gt; when available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>within-participant studies</strong>:
&gt; Effect sizes for this type of
&gt; study are calculated the <strong>same way as in between-participant
&gt; studies</strong>, but in order to calculate the weight of these studies
&gt; the <strong>correlation</strong> between the first and second measurements is
&gt; required (to account for the amount of
&gt; within-participant variation). Since this measure is usually not
&gt; reported, we provide below median and range for correlations found
&gt; in existing MAs.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Infant word segmentation from native speech: 0.641 (range: 0.140 to 0.921)</p></li>
<li><p>Infant vowel discrimination (native and nonnative): 0.496 (range: -0.413 to 0.855)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>en entering papers, please remember a key thing: all analyses are done
by machines, and machines cannot read text! So if a column is “numeric”,
please do <strong><em>not</em></strong> enter things that aren’t numbers (such as text,
spaces, ~, etc). This is particularly important for the dependent
measures!</p>
<p>At this stage, you might find that a given paper does not contain the
right information for being included. In this case, you can and should
exclude it. If you have already started entering it, you can leave the
information you entered and put in “comments” that the entry is
incomplete (although if you followed our advice above, you won’t have
wasted time entering it!). Remember to update your spreadsheet with each
paper you read and made a decision on.</p>
<p><strong><em>The article I enter has 3 experiments, and the first is with adult participants. Do I need to enter this experiment?</em></strong></p>
<p>No, please only enter the infant/child experiments</p>
</div>
<div id="what-level-of-detail-should-i-report" class="section level3">
<h3>What level of detail should I report?</h3>
<p><strong><em>The sound stimuli differ approx. 6 ms in length, but the experiment is not about length differences. Do I have to report this difference although it is very small?</em></strong></p>
<p>In case there’s a column for stimulus length, please report it. You are right that this experiment is not about length differences, but having the information cannot hurt, and eventual analyses will reflect that the difference is very small.</p>
<p><strong><em>The article reports a table with the lengths of each individual stimulus. Should I calculate and report the average value?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes, please report the averaged value in the appropriate column.</p>
<p><strong><em>I am entering an article with the HAS method. The authors report results for both the 2 and 4 minutes after the test phase has started. Your example only reports the results after 2 minutes, but would you still want me to report both?</em></strong></p>
<p>It is often the case that articles report more than one type of result. Please just report the ones that we also provide in the example file!</p>

<div id="effect-sizes" class="section level1">
<h1>Effect Sizes</h1>
<div id="what-are-effect-sizes" class="section level3">
<h3>What are effect sizes?</h3>
<p>In MAs (meta-analyses) we express the outcome of a single experiment in a way that captures how big an effect is and how much it varies. There are 3 groups of effect sizes:<br />
1. effect sizes based on means, which includes Cohen’s <em>d</em> on which we focus from here on;<br />
2. effect sizes based on binary data; and<br />
3. effect sizes based on correlations.</p>
<p>Since most developmental studies in the lab use mean responses of two groups or of the same infant in two (or more) conditions, Cohen’s d is the appropriate effect size measure. This <a href="http://www.meta-analysis.com/downloads/Meta-analysis%20Choosing%20an%20effect%20size.pdf">chapter 3</a> and the following ones provide a gentle introduction to effect sizes. Cohen’s d is based on standardized mean differences. To get a feel for Cohen’s d we highly recommend to play with the <a href="http://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/">visualization</a> of RPsychologist. A list of recommended readings is also provided at the end of this document.</p>
<p>In a typical infant study, babies might hear two types of trials and the responses to each are compared. In most papers, it is sufficient that the difference between the trial types reaches statistical significance, but in a meta-analyses we care about the size of this single observed effect and its variance. This allows us to pool over several studies, weigh each datapoint, and arrive at an estimate of the underlying, true effect. This then allows us to calculate power and check how effect sizes might be systematically affected by variables such as infant age in “moderator analyses”.</p>

<li><p><strong>between-participant studies</strong>:<br />
&gt; Means and SDs (not SEs!) of the dependent variable for each infant group are all that is required for the calculation of Cohen’s <em>d</em>. Sometimes, means and SDs are not available as numbers. If there are clear figures, you can try to estimate means and SDs using <a href="http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/"><strong>this online app</strong></a> or <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13118"><strong>the R package metaDigitise</strong></a>. If you decide to estimate values from figures, add a column to keep track of this. Finally, <strong>t or F values for the <em>main</em> effect in combination with sample sizes</strong> can be used to calculate Cohen’s <em>d</em>. Note them when available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>within-participant studies</strong>:<br />
&gt; Effect sizes for this type of study are calculated the <strong>same way as in between-participant studies</strong>, but in order to calculate the weight of these studies the <strong>correlation</strong> between the first and second measurements is required (to account for the amount of within-participant variation). Since this measure is usually not reported, we provide below median and range for correlations found in existing MAs.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Infant word segmentation from native speech: 0.641 (range: 0.140 to 0.921)</p></li>
<li><p>Infant vowel discrimination (native and nonnative): 0.496 (range: -0.413 to 0.855)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>When entering papers, please remember a key thing: all analyses are done
by machines, and machines cannot read text! So if a column is “numeric”,
please do <strong><em>not</em></strong> enter things that aren’t numbers (such as text,
spaces, ~, etc). This is particularly important for the dependent
measures!</p>
<p>At this stage, you might find that a given paper does not contain the
right information for being included. In this case, you can and should
exclude it. If you have already started entering it, you can leave the
information you entered and put in “comments” that the entry is
incomplete (although if you followed our advice above, you won’t have
wasted time entering it!). Remember to update your spreadsheet with each
paper you read and made a decision on.</p>
<p><strong><em>The article I enter has 3 experiments, and the first is with adult participants. Do I need to enter this experiment?</em></strong></p>
<p>No, please only enter the infant/child experiments</p>
</div>
<div id="what-level-of-detail-should-i-report-1" class="section level3">
<h3>What level of detail should I report?</h3>
<p><strong><em>The sound stimuli differ approx. 6 ms in length, but the experiment is not about length differences. Do I have to report this difference although it is very small?</em></strong></p>
<p>In case there’s a column for stimulus length, please report it. You are right that this experiment is not about length differences, but having the information cannot hurt, and eventual analyses will reflect that the difference is very small.</p>
<p><strong><em>The article reports a table with the lengths of each individual stimulus. Should I calculate and report the average value?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes, please report the averaged value in the appropriate column.</p>
<p><strong><em>I am entering an article with the HAS method. The authors report results for both the 2 and 4 minutes after the test phase has started. Your example only reports the results after 2 minutes, but would you still want me to report both?</em></strong></p>
<p>It is often the case that articles report more than one type of result. Please just report the ones that we also provide in the example file!</p>
