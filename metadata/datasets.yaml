Both controlled-vocabulary and natural-language searches were conducted (Lucas & Cutspec, 2007). Psychological Abstracts (PsychInfo), Educational Resource Information Center (ERIC), MEDLINE, Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, Education Resource Complete, and Dissertation Abstracts International were searched. These were supplemented by Google Scholar, Scirus, and Ingenta searches as well as a search of an extensive EndNote Library maintained by our Institute. Hand searches of the reference sections of all retrieved journal articles, book chapters, books, dissertations, and unpublished papers were also examined to locate additional studies. Studies were included if the effects of infant-directed speech on child behavior were compared to the effects of adult-directed speech on child behavior. Studies that intentionally manipulated word boundaries (e.g., Hirsh-Pasek et al., 1987; Nelson, Hirsh-Pasek, Jusczyk, & Cassidy, 1989) or used nonsense words or phrases (e.g., Mattys, Jusczyk, Luce, & Morgan, 1999; Thiessen, Hill, & Saffran, 2005) were excluded."'

Although we coded all papers that fit these criteria, we focused on papers with a simple two-alternative forced choice (9 papers); integrating across different numbers of alternatives added additional complexity to our model. In our first iteration of this analysis, we found that very few studies reported reaction times for gaze following, and those that did had no data from children older than 15 months and no data from gaze plus pointing. To remedy this issue we include new analyses of data from Yurovsky, Wade, & Frank (2013) and Yurovsky & Frank (2015)."'

Inspection of the reference section of relevant literature was an additional search method (ancestry method). Additionally, also unpublished sources were consulted, such as dissertations and presentations and studies under revision, by using Google Scholar, contacting researchers in the field and consulting digital databases of dissertations (e.g., PROQUEST). Three selection criteria were used to select studies: (a) measurement of infant production and/or comprehension of the pointing gesture; (b) measurement of language by assessing either receptive or expressive language; (c) report of a relation between pointing and language or the presence of data in the article allowing the calculation of a relation between pointing and language development. Exclusion criteria were: (a) subjects with mental or developmental disorders; (b) children older than 60 months; (c) studies in which the pointing gesture was not coded separately from other gestures."'

    search_strategy: '"We followed the PRISMA statement (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altmann, & The PRISMA Group, 2009) for selecting and reporting on the studies to be included in our meta-analysis. We decided to include articles if they were assessing the on-line processing of sound-symbolically matching or mismatching sound-shape correspondences related to the bouba-kiki effect (thus, testing both ‘round’ and ‘spiky’ correspondences) in children up to and inclusive of the age of 3 years.  ‘Matching’ responses refer to children’s responses to congruent sound-shape associations (round word+round object; spiky word+spiky object) and ‘mismatching’  responses refer to children’s responses to incongruent sound-shape associations (round word+spiky shape; spiky word+round shape), respectively. Since we were already aware of 10 published articles, conference presentations or conference proceedings papers that fit our inclusion criteria,and since we considered our strict inclusion this criteria to lead to a rather small selection of articles, we chose a seed strategy rather than a broad literature search. We began by assembling 4 key articles that fit the inclusion criteria (Asano et al., 2015; Maurer, Pathman & Mondloch, 2006; Ozturk, Krehm & Vouloumanos, 2012; Spector & Maurer, 2013) as well as two recent review papers on sound symbolism including infancy (Imai & Kita, 2014; Lockwood & Dingemanse, 2015). For all of these articles, we screened all potentially relevant references cited in these articles as well as references citing these articles and ‘related articles’ on their title and abstracts on scholar.google.com. Additionally, we screened titles and abstracts of all articles that cited one of the 4 key articles mentioned above (Asano et al. 2015: 16 citations; Maurer et al. 2006: 241 citations; Ozturk et al. 2012: 54 citations and Spector and Maurer, 2013: 9 citations).  This search did not lead to additional eligible articles. In addition, we were aware of 9 conference presentations or conference proceedings papers that fit our inclusion criteria and were not redundant with one of our seed articles, including three by the two first authors of the present article."'

Of the first 110 results titles and abstract were screened. An additional search on 15 October 2018 on the search term ‘word segmentation infants NIRS’ resulted in 117 items. In addition, experts were asked for additional articles, resulting in 13 items. All of these items (240 items) were screened on their titles and abstracts. Twenty-one of these items were included and full-text inspection was done using the following inclusion criteria; (1) the participants were infants and were normally developing; (2) The method that was used was EEG or NIRS (Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy); (3) the stimuli material was continuous natural speech spoken in the infants’ native language. Studies reporting on rule learning, word-object mapping, or artificial grammar were excluded. Inspection of full-text resulted in the inclusion of 12 items."'

    search_strategy: "A search was conducted for studies using the Senju & Csibra (2008) paradigm of infant gaze-following. In order to find these, a search for the terms “gaze”, “follow” and “infant” was carried out on all peer-reviewed, published studies citing the original paper, resulting in 366 results. Abstracts were scanned to determine whether the full paper should be read, and full papers were included if they used the original paradigm with human typically developing infants and reported (or provided the data to calculate) the measure of first look difference score (congruent - incongruent). In total, 15 papers have been included. 4 additional papers were not included as information for calculating effect sizes could not be obtained from the manuscript."

    search_strategy: "The search keywords included terms relevant to the predictor, the outcome, and the population. Both general outcome terms (e.g., “imitation”) and specific gestures (e.g., “tongue protrusion”) were used. Thus, each search query contained elements of both (a) “imitation” or “tongue protrusion” or “mouth opening” or “lip smacking” and (b) “neonates” or “infants” or “children.” We also searched the reference sections of previous reviews on neonatal imitation and the reference sections of included studies, and we requested unpublished datasets via a developmental psychology email list. All searches were limited to abstracts when this option was available. We selected electronic databases that included relevant journals in the fields of child development, infant psychology, and related fields and on the basis of source overlap and usability. In addition, we searched sources of unpublished literature, such as dissertations and theses, that may include null or negative results. The data sources selected were ProQuest (including ProQuest Dissertations and Theses), Scopus, PsycInfo (including PsycArticles), and Cambridge University Library and Dependent Libraries Catalogue. In addition, we searched Google Scholar using a more stringent set of search keywords."
